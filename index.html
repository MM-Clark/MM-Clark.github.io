            I &hearts; animals, athletics, and being outdoors. I also enjoy programming, which makes sense because I am a Computer Science Major.

            &diam; Fun fact: I have been figure skating for nine years. I am currently transitioning from being a solo freestyler to an ice dancer. I am also a USFS Triple Gold Medalist. I also like dinosaurs. They're cool. &#x1F996;

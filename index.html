        <p>&bull; I enjoy figure skating, painting, and playing Pokemon Go. </p>

        <p>&bull; Fun Fact: I am a USFS Triple Gold Medalist in Solo Freeskate, Moves in the Field, and Solo Free Dance. As of July 2023, Solo Freeskate is now called Singles, and Moves in the Field is now called Skating Skills. It's really confusing.</p>
